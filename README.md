cobra-iradar-notifier
=====================

This is an Android app to display Cobra iRadar notifications as system popups. The stock iRadar app sucks, does not start up properly and fails to route audio to speakers/BT headset.

The app is in alpha stage: UI is sucky, and there are bugs. It does connect to iRadar device,  reads incoming alerts, displays them (even multiple alerts at once).

All code is open-source without any licensing model implied. Take it, use it as you see fit, provide me credits if you think its appropriate.

TODO:
 * clean up UI
 * false alert detection
 * submit alerts automatically to Waze
