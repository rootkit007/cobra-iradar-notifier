cobra-iradar-notifier
=====================

This is an Android app to display Cobra iRadar notifications as system popups. The stock iRadar app sucks, does not start up properly and fails to route audio to speakers/BT headset.

The app is in "proof of concept" stage: UI sucks, it does not resume properly, does not automatically reconnect after connection loss etc. It does connect to iRadar device, and reads incoming alerts, and displays them.

All code is open-source without any licensing model implied. Take it, use it as you see fit, provide me credits if you think its appropriate.

TODO:
 * clean up UI
 * user-modifiable preferences
 * better background service handling (to automatically connect/reconnect to the device)
 * false alert detection
 * submit alerts automatically to Waze
